# comscore-sample

This is a sample that mocks an importer tool for a simple custom datastore, as well as a separate query tool to be used on the datastore.

Simply run make in the root project directory, and the root Makefile will call the Makefiles for the 'datastore' and 'query' child projects.
These projects will be placed in the 'bin' directory, where there is also some sample data sets to import.

TODO: Outline usage of 'datastore' and 'query' tools.
